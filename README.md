>These are the files necessary to replicate the study “New divergence-time estimates for hominins provide insight into encephalization and body mass trends in human evolution” by Hans P. Püschel, Ornella C. Bertrand, Joseph E. O’Reilly, René Bobe & Thomas A. Püschel

## Contents ##

1) The **Nexus_files** folder contains all the nexus files necessary to replicate the TED analyses in MrBayes for the four topological hypothesis tested in our paper (see the methods section for more details). 

2) The **.con.tre** files correspond to the majority rule consensus trees obtained in the TED analyses for the four topological hypotheses. These files are necessary to run the R scripts contained in **R_scripts_TED_hominin.Rmd**. These files can also be obtained if the full analysis is replicated using the nexus files in MrBayes.

3) The **.csv** files correspond to tables with information about body mass, brain mass and PEQ for each one of the taxa analysed in our paper. These files are necessary to run the R scripts contained in **R_scripts_TED_hominin.Rmd**.

4) The **post_tc_trees.txt** files contained the 9002 time-calibrated posterior trees sampled for each one of the four analyses. These are necessary to run the fifth section of the script in **R_scripts_TED_hominin.Rmd**. These files can also be obtained if the full analysis is replicated using the nexus files in MrBayes, and then using the code available in the fifth section of **R_scripts_TED_hominin.Rmd** with the **.t** and **.p files**. 

5) The **R_scripts_TED_hominin.Rmd** file contains all the scripts necessary to replicate this study.
